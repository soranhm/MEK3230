MEK3230 â€“ Fluid Mechanics

## Course content
The course gives an introduction to fluid mechanics i.e. the mathematical description of the motion of liquids and gases (fluids). The course gives a continuum description of fluids, which is based on the equations for mass conservation and momentum balance (Navier Stokes equations). Fluid mechanics is essential to a wide range of industrial applications such as offshore technology, oil and gas industry, wind energy, meteorology, geological flows as well as biological systems, where the course is an ideal starting point for students with a broad interest in mathematical applications.
